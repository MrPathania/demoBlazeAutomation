# demoBlazeAutomation
This is a project where I have automated the https://www.demoblaze.com/.
To run the script install the playwright on your systm using the following commands on your vs code:
npx install playwright

After that if you want to create a new user and buy a product then use the following command on the vs code terminal:
npm run signup

And if you want to check the incorrect password functionality then run the following command on the vs code terminal:
npm run loginflow

And there is also a script where I have stored the user's logged in state so that you don't need to login again and again. To check that use the following command on the vs code terminal:
npm run userstate
